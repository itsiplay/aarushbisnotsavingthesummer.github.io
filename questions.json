This means the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the line. The slope of the line y = 4x + b is 4, so the slope of the radius is –1/4.  The radius passes through (0, 0), so the equation of the radius is y = –1/4x. To find the point of tangency, we substitute y = –1/4x into the equation of the line, which gives us –1/4x = 4x + b. Solving for x yields x = –b/17. Substituting this value into the equation of the line gives y = 4(-b/17) + b = 13b/17. The point of tangency has coordinates (-b/17, 13b/17). The distance from this point to the center of the circle, (0, 0), is 5, so we can set up the distance formula: \\begin{align*}\\sqrt{(-b/17 - 0)^2 + (13b/17 - 0)^2} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{(b^2/289) + (169b^2/289)} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\sqrt{(170b^2/289)} &= 5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 170b^2/289 &= 25\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 170b^2 &= 7,225\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad b^2 &= 42.5\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad b &= \\pm 6.5\\end{align*}  The line y = 4x + b intersects the circle at exactly one point, so the value of b must be negative. Therefore, b = -6.5, which is equivalent to -20/3, or -20/3.

Since we're given that $x - y = 3$, we need to find the value of $x + y$. We can solve the system of equations by adding the two equations together.  $x^{2} + y^{2} + (x - y) = 25 + 3$, which simplifies to $x^{2} + x + y^{2} - y = 28$.  Since $x^{2} + y^{2} = 25$, we can substitute that value into the equation.  $25 + x - y = 28$.  Since $x - y = 3$, we can substitute that value into the equation.  $25 + 3 = 28$.  Therefore, $x^{2} - y^{2} = (x + y)(x - y) = (28)(3) = 84$.  Since 84 is not a choice, we need to look for an equivalent expression.  We can factor out a 3 from 84:  $84 = 3(28) = 3(10 + 18) = 30 + 54$.

Since the side length of the equilateral triangle is 6, the height of the triangle is 3√3.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get $(7-y)^2 + y^2 = 25$. Expanding the equation, we get $49 - 14y + y^2 + y^2 = 25$. Combining like terms, we get $2y^2 - 14y + 24 = 0$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(y-3)(y-4) = 0$. Therefore, $y = 3$ or $y = 4$. Substituting these values back into the equation $x = 7 - y$, we get the points of intersection as $(4,3)$ and $(3,4)$. The distance between these two points can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(4-3)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1} = \\sqrt{2}$.

The researchers theorize that larger feet may be an indicator of health and fitness.  In order to further their research, the team wanted to determine whether the birds’ preference for large feet is a learned behavior or an instinctive one.  To this end, the researchers conducted an experiment in which some blue-footed boobies were raised in captivity and then released into the wild.   To measure the birds’ preference for large feet, the researchers observed whether the birds, when given a choice between two potential mates, would choose the mate with the larger feet.  Of the twenty birds that were raised in captivity, fourteen chose the mate with the larger feet.  This finding suggests that the blue-footed booby’s preference for large feet may be an instinctive behavior, rather than a learned one.  Although the researchers’ findings do not prove their hypothesis, the results are suggestive.  However, the researchers acknowledged that their experiment had a significant limitation.  The birds were only allowed to choose between two potential mates, so it is not possible to know for certain that the birds would choose the mate with the larger feet if given more options.

Dadaists rejected traditional art forms and sought to create art that was nonsensical and often provocative. One of the key figures of the Dada movement was the artist Marcel Duchamp, whose work is known for its playful and sometimes shocking nature. In 1917, Duchamp submitted a porcelain urinal to an art exhibition under the name “Fountain.” The urinal was rejected by the organizers of the exhibition, but it has since become one of the most famous works of Dada art. Duchamp’s work, and Dadaism in general, challenged the traditional values of art and challenged the very definition of what art could be.","explanation":"The passage states that Dadaists sought to create art that was “nonsensical and often provocative.”  The passage also states that Duchamp’s work “challenged the traditional values of art and challenged the very definition of what art could be.” Thus, the main purpose of the Dada movement was to create a new art form that was more nonsensical and provocative.","correct_answer":"D"},"difficulty":"Medium"},{"id":"948f5136","domain":"Craft and Structure","visuals":{"type":"null","svg_content":"null"},"question":{"choices":{"A":"introduce the main idea of the advertisement.","B":"emphasize the superiority of the product.","C":"explain the benefits of using real meat as an ingredient.","D":"describe the process of formulating the dog food."},"question":"The phrase \"unlike other dog foods\" functions primarily to","paragraph":"An advertisement for a new brand of dog food states that, “Unlike other dog foods, [this dog food] is formulated with real meat as the first ingredient.”","explanation":"The phrase \"unlike other dog foods\" sets up a comparison that highlights the superiority of this particular dog food.

The movement was also inspired by a growing sense that the modern world was losing something essential—a connection to the natural world.  However, while the wilderness movement’s goals are still championed today, the movement’s approach to preserving wild places has become more nuanced in recent years.

While some scholars believe that the most important aspect of the study of history is the exploration of the past through the examination of primary sources, others argue that a more holistic approach is needed, one that considers the broader historical context and the impact of historical events on the present.  The following passage from a scholarly essay discusses this debate.  \n\n      \"Historians have long debated the best way to approach the study of history.  Some historians argue that the best way to understand the past is to focus on primary sources.  They argue that these sources provide an unfiltered look into the past, allowing historians to see the world through the eyes of those who lived it.  However, other historians contend that a more holistic approach is needed, one that considers the broader historical context in which events occurred, as well as the impact of those events on the present.  To understand the past, they argue, it is necessary to see the world as a complex web of interconnected events that have shaped the present.   In other words, they suggest, it is important to avoid viewing history as a series of isolated facts.   \n\n        In this way, the two approaches can be seen as two sides of the same coin.  Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses.  Historians who focus on primary sources are more likely to produce accounts that are grounded in the evidence.  However, their accounts may also be more limited in scope, failing to address the complexities of the historical context.   \n\n        Historians who take a more holistic approach are more likely to produce accounts that are broader in scope and more nuanced in their understanding of the past.    However, their accounts may also be more prone to bias and interpretation.   \n\n        Ultimately, the best way to approach the study of history is to find a balance between these two approaches.\"  \n\n       What is the most likely reason that the author of this passage refers to the two approaches as “two sides of the same coin”?

The rise of electronic music in the twentieth century, with its reliance on synthesizers and computers, furthered the trend toward a more artificial sound. This technological trend has reached its apotheosis in the present day, with the proliferation of digital music streaming services that have rendered the traditional model of music consumption obsolete.

The concept of the arrow of time seems self-evident, and yet it raises a fundamental question about the nature of reality.  If time is truly unidirectional, then does this imply that the past is somehow gone, vanished, or inaccessible, or that the future does not yet exist?

The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.","explanation":"Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “disturbed” most nearly means alarmed.
